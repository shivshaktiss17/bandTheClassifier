Server configuration, basically to classify images. Project using Inception network basically.

This project contains all the information regarding setting up the **Apache Server** and **Image classification**.

## Process:

      (1) Setting up Apache2 WSGI server on VPS.
  
      (2) Install required libraries(Flask Web Framework, Tensorflow, numpy, Keras...).
  
      (3) Write Python code for Image Classification(Inception V3 model).
  
      (4) Using Postman sending request and getting response as JSON text.
  
  
  ### Go through the commands and requirement file to know the requirements(with specific versions).
  
  ### Specific Libraries version
